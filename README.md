My project is a drink making game where you try to make the right drink to satisfy your customers. The end goal is to make 200 dollars to pay for your medical fee. You play by clicking on the ingredients to add them to the mixing cup, once you've added 3 ingredients (as indicated below the cup), you'll be able to find out if you got the drink right or not. If you got it right, the customer will be happy and leave. If you got it wrong, nothing happens and you can use the garbage button on the top right to restart your drink. If you get the drink right first try, you earn $10, otherwise, you only get $5. Once the week is up, you'll reach either the good end or bad end depending on your money made. Enjoy the cats!
(p.s. there is no cheat mode)
(p.s.s you can move the paw in the intro)
